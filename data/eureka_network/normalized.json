For example, when exploring or developing a research and development (R&D) project idea, or after a successful R&D project to understand whether their new product, process or service might be commercialised in targeted global markets.Are you an innovative SME wanting to carry out a market feasibility study in a country in the Americas, Africa, Asia, or Oceania? We have funding for you!What is a market feasibility project?A market feasibility project includes preliminary technical, market, legal and/or socioeconomic assessments intended to validate the feasibility of your international and innovative business solution (product-, process- or service-market combination) within new and emerging global value chains. Your market feasibility project must:Have a target country (a pilot market) where you intend to develop and validate your innovative business solution in collaboration with local counterparts. You should consider, where appropriate, frugal innovation.Be led byan innovative SME from a European Union Member State or Iceland, Israel, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye, or United Kingdom.Have one local partner(e.g., a supplier, customer, end user, research provider, or complementary technology developer)in the selected target country, as main subcontractor for the market feasibility project. The expected outcome must have a high impact in the target country (pilot market).Feature product- (or process-, or service-) market development.Include a variety of activities to identify and assess key local technical and market framework conditions in the target country that may favour or impede the effective deployment of your innovation.What is fundedThe fourth Innowwide call has a 4.2 million euro budget to fund70 projects(60,000 euro per market feasibility project). This call for projects isbottom-up,meaning you decide the focus of your project.Innowwide is mono beneficiary.The programme supports theorganisation in the EU member state, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye, or United Kingdom, but entities in target countries that SMEs choose to collaborate with can benefit indirectly as subcontractors. The subcontractors are not party to the grant agreement i.e., they do not have a contractual relationship with the Funding Authority.Funding for each project is a maximum of 60,000 euro. Since the Innowwide maximum funding support rate is 70%, the total eligible project costs must be at least 86,000 euro, with beneficiaries self-funding any project costs beyond 60,000 euro.Eligible costs include personnel, subcontracting, purchasing costs – travel and subsistence, equipment depreciation, other goods, works and services; and indirect costs (automatically calculated on the basis of a 25% flat-rate of the total direct eligible costs, excluding subcontracting).Each successful market feasibility project will receive afixed grant of 60,000 euro. The funding to each SME market feasibility project coordinator will be processed as follows:A pre-financing of 70% (42,000 euro) provided at the beginning of project implementation.The remaining 30% (18,000 euro) transferred at the end of the market feasibility project after its obligatory 6 months duration, upon delivery and acceptance of a complete Final Report by the Eureka Innowwide team. If the report is not acceptable, the market feasibility project beneficiaries could be requested to present additional information within one month. Should the information provided still be insufficient, the grant could be reduced, or the market feasibility project could be declared as withdrawn and the beneficiaries required to repay the pre-financing.Who can applyTo apply, you must fulfil nine eligibility criteria:The application is complete. It includes the application form itself, the annex (workplan) in the template provided and all declarations, including your main subcontractor’s commitment.The applicant SME is a legally constituted SME according to EU recommendation 2003/361, in an eligible country participating in Innowwide (EU Member States, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye, or United Kingdom).The project includes an independent subcontractor (local counterpart) in the target country.The project has an exclusive focus on civil applications.None of the participating organisations have convictions for fraudulent behaviour, other financial irregularities or unethical and illegal business practices; is bankrupt or in the process of being declared bankrupt; or is ‘undertaking in difficulty’ according to the EU definition (Article 2, no. 18 of COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 651/2014 of June 2014).The project duration is six months.The minimum total eligible project costs is 86,000 euro.The subcontracting cost are above zero euro.The project includes a combination of eligible activities.Please read all our guidelines before submitting a project application.

Since the Innowwide maximum funding support rate is 70%, the total eligible project costs must be at least 86,000 euro, with beneficiaries self-funding any project costs beyond 60,000 euro.Eligible costs include personnel, subcontracting, purchasing costs – travel and subsistence, equipment depreciation, other goods, works and services; and indirect costs (automatically calculated on the basis of a 25% flat-rate of the total direct eligible costs, excluding subcontracting).Each successful market feasibility project will receive afixed grant of 60,000 euro. The funding to each SME market feasibility project coordinator will be processed as follows:A pre-financing of 70% (42,000 euro) provided at the beginning of project implementation.The remaining 30% (18,000 euro) transferred at the end of the market feasibility project after its obligatory 6 months duration, upon delivery and acceptance of a complete Final Report by the Eureka Innowwide team. If the report is not acceptable, the market feasibility project beneficiaries could be requested to present additional information within one month. Should the information provided still be insufficient, the grant could be reduced, or the market feasibility project could be declared as withdrawn and the beneficiaries required to repay the pre-financing.Who can applyTo apply, you must fulfil nine eligibility criteria:The application is complete. It includes the application form itself, the annex (workplan) in the template provided and all declarations, including your main subcontractor’s commitment.The applicant SME is a legally constituted SME according to EU recommendation 2003/361, in an eligible country participating in Innowwide (EU Member States, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Switzerland, Türkiye, or United Kingdom).The project includes an independent subcontractor (local counterpart) in the target country.The project has an exclusive focus on civil applications.None of the participating organisations have convictions for fraudulent behaviour, other financial irregularities or unethical and illegal business practices; is bankrupt or in the process of being declared bankrupt; or is ‘undertaking in difficulty’ according to the EU definition (Article 2, no. 18 of COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 651/2014 of June 2014).The project duration is six months.The minimum total eligible project costs is 86,000 euro.The subcontracting cost are above zero euro.The project includes a combination of eligible activities.Please read all our guidelines before submitting a project application.

The E5 currently comprises of 5 members: the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, Business Finland, Enterprise Singapore, Israel Innovation Authority and Vinnova.One of four thematic Working Groups, EARTH Cities, aims to accelerate the development and scale-up of innovative technologies for carbon-neutral cities by facilitating cross-sector innovation and co-innovation between the public and private sectors among the E5 members.This call for projects has been launched by Austria, Finland, Israel, Singapore, and Sweden following Eureka’s Network Projects framework.Funding informationThis call is for research and development projects in the field of sustainable cities.A sustainable city is an urban system that meets the social and economic needs of all its residents today, while operating within the Earth’s ecological limits, so that future generations can also thrive. In practice this means the city:Minimises resource inputs and harmful outputs (energy, water, food, waste, pollution).Ensures universal access to safe, affordable housing, services, and mobility in ways that are inclusive and participatory.Supports a resilient, low-carbon economy that provides decent jobs and long-term prosperity.Builds adaptive capacity to climate, health and other shocks through nature-based and technological solutions, evidence-based governance, and engaged communities.Collaborative international R&D and technology development projects can help countries/cities address green transition challenges and needs as countries/cities work towards building nature-positive cities.Projects under Sustainable Cities could be in the following areas, but this list is not exhaustive:Advanced materials for the built environmentBuilt materials as an energy source/storageSustainable construction solutions/building materialsRadiative cooling (active/passive)Low- or net-carbon building materials (e.g., CO2mineralisation, calcium carbonate solutions)Circular construction (e.g. use of biochar, reuse of construction demolition waste)Sustainable energyRenewable energy technologies (solar, hydrogen) and related applications (e.g. hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen purification)Energy storage systemsGrid technologies (e.g. in the areas of grid efficiency/resilience/cyber-security, grid feed-ins)Energy communitiesSpot-pricing opportunitiesResource circularityWaste managementApplications of recycled materials (e.g. waste to high-value products/building materials)Urban mobilityEV charging infrastructureDigital toolsAIPublic transport enhancementGreen logisticsWho can applyTo apply, you must meet several eligibility criteria:Your project idea must represent international cooperation in the form of a specific project.The project must be directed at researching or developing an innovative product, process or service with the goal of commercialisation.The project must have a civilian purpose.Your consortium must include at least two independent legal entities from a minimum of two Eureka Call participating countries. Please note, that organisations from non-participating countries are welcome to join if (public or self-) funding is secured by the call deadline.No single organisation or country can be responsible for more than 70% of the project budget.Your project, process, or service must be innovative and there must be a technological risk involved.Projects must address the theme, ‘Sustainable Cities’, and have at least one clear and specific application within the theme.Your project should be researching and developing a product, process or service for commercialisation and the implementation of project results (such as market launch) should aim to occur no later than 24 months after project completion. Innovative proposals demonstrating novel methodologies or groundbreaking solutions that transcend conventional practices will be prioritised in the evaluation process.Projects may develop fundamentally new innovations, or adapt, re-engineer and re-purpose existing innovations currently used or envisaged for different application areas. While the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) starting point will vary from one project to another, it is expected that projects will start no lower than TRL level 4.",

Once the individual evaluation reports are finalised, therapporteurwill draft an evaluationconsensus reportand put forward comments that match the consensus scores based on the individual evaluation reports.The experts who have evaluated each proposal must agree and electronically approve the consensus report, including the comments and scores. In cases where experts do not agree, the consensus report, together with the disagreement notes, will be forwarded to the independent evaluation panel.The top 105 proposals (one and a half times the total number of projects to be funded) from remote evaluation that score above threshold, progress to the independent evaluation panel and ethics review.If some proposals have tied scores with the 105th proposal, those also progress to the independent evaluation panel and ethics review.For proposals below threshold or not in the top 105, the outcome of the consensus phase will constitute the result of the evaluation, and there will be no panel review.Anindependent evaluation panelwill decide a ranking list based on evaluation results.Anethics panelreview the list of applications that received a successful evaluation, discarding those that do not comply with relevant ethics requirements.Communication of results:Each applicant will receive a single evaluation report, including qualitative feedback and scores based on the conclusions of the expert’s assessments.If your project application was rejected and you believe this was due to a procedural mistake during the eligibility check or the evaluation of your application, you can submit a redress request. A redress request can only be based on procedural grounds, with clear evidence of the reasons for complaint.Ranking list:The final independent evaluation panel ranking list and the ethics scrutiny will include:a ‘selection list’ with applications that might receive funding;a ‘reserve list’ with applications that may in the end get funding if one or more applications in the selection list cannot sign a grant agreement.Funding will be awarded on the basis of this ranking, subject to the call availability budget.Following the order set up in the ranking list, the first 70 successful SME market feasibility project coordinators will be sent a Grant Agreement by the Innowwide team at the Eureka Secretariat to be completed and duly signed within the period specified in the notification email. If any of them fail to sign within this period, applicant SMEs in the reserve list following the ranking order will be offered a contract until budget exhaustion.It is intended to communicate the evaluation results during the first quarter of 2025.",

It is a departure from the traditional, so called linear economic model, which often relies on large quantities of cheap, easily accessible materials and energy.As amodel of production and consumptioncircular economy involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible. When a product reaches the end of its life, its materials are kept within the economy wherever possible thanks to recycling. Productive reuse creates further value.Circular value creationgoes beyond recycling and waste management. It requires novel strategies for product design, cross-sectoral partnerships, new materials and technologies as well as business models guided by the principles of longevity, reuse and recycling. It is expected to lay the basis for flexibility, change and resilience in value creation systems, fostering opportunities for sustainable economic development, competitiveness and job creation.Companies’ workforces should be empowered to build and develop a circular mindset and the corresponding skills and knowledge.

      "description": "Areas fundedThis project call is for R&D projects within lightweighting technologies.Lightweighting technology is a key enabling technology to reduce weight, save materials, and improve functionality while maintaining or enhancing performance. Smart lightweight design, advanced materials, and optimised manufacturing processes are crucial parameters. Digital solutions for calculation models, production processes, and performance evaluation are essential tools for driving innovation in lightweighting. Lightweighting technology provides environmentally friendly solutions while simultaneously adding commercial value across multiple industries.Effects targeted by lightweighting technologies include:Optimisation of resource and energy efficiencySmart lightweight design helps to reduce material and energy consumption during the manufacturing and use phase of new materials and products. Increasing the duration of use and lifespan of lightweight materials and products by wear reduction, slowing down the aging process, and improving material fatigue contributes to resource and energy efficiency. Structural health monitoring of existing and new components indicates when repair or replacement is necessary, further contributing to resource efficiency. The use of simulations, virtual models (digital twin), intelligent process control (machine learning), and automation allows predictive manufacturing, reductions in time-to-market, processing times, and material waste from substandard products, significantly reducing environmental impact and CO2 emissions.Maximising efficiency and performanceLightweighting enables not only weight reduction, but also optimised material use and structural principles for maximum efficiency and performance. The challenge is to develop and implement advanced lightweighting technologies that enable load-optimised material usage while maintaining or improving functionality. This requires integrating digital solutions such as simulations, virtual models (digital twins), and intelligent process control to enhance flexibility and adaptability in lightweight design. Modern manufacturing methods, including additive manufacturing, open new possibilities for application-specific production. To fully unlock the potential of lightweighting, innovative approaches in material selection, shaping, and production must be explored to create economic value.Bolstering lightweight advancements in mobility and integration in more areasThe mobility sector remains a core focus for lightweighting advancements due to its high potential for efficiency gains and environmental impact reduction. Further improvements in lightweight materials, structures, and manufacturing techniques are essential for achieving enhanced fuel efficiency and sustainability in automotive, aerospace, railway, and maritime applications. At the same time, expanding lightweight solutions beyond mobility to other sectors can unlock additional benefits. Standardisation of new lightweight materials, technologies, measuring and testing methods, the development of digital twins, interconnected production processes, and accessible databases on lightweight materials encourage the transfer and development of new lightweight technologies across industries.Relevant industry sectors include (but are not limited to):Regardless of national priorities, all sectors with a need for lightweighting technologies are welcome, including but not limited to automotive, railway, aerospace, space, maritime, mechanical engineering, energy, construction, infrastructure, health, farming, and forestry, etc.Call-relevant lightweighting technologies to be researched and developed include (but are not limited to):Optimisation of lightweight design approachesTopology optimisation considering load paths and lightweight designAdvanced simulation approachesHybrid lightweight constructionFunctional integrationSmart/intelligent componentsCondition monitoringNovel lightweight materials including optimised manufacturingAdvanced material research for enhanced lightweight performanceHard coatings and technologies enabling a lifetime expansionProcess automationSimulations and virtual models (digital twin)Intelligent process control (machine learning)Standardisation of new lightweight materials and technologiesStandardisation of measuring and testing methodsDevelopment of accessible databases on lightweight materialsRecycling of lightweight materialsIncreasing the use of secondary materialsTechnologies for disjoiningTechnologies for traceability of chemical compositionsJoining technologySmart adhesivesPre-treatment of surfacesNew joining technologiesDevelopment of new welding consumables and solders for special metal mixing combinationsDevelopment of joining processes for high-strength and low-ductile lightweight materials or mixed connections made of metal-plastic fiber compositesAdditive manufacturingMulti-material solutions optimised for lightweight applicationsDevelopment of in-situ quality measurement methodsOptimisation of build-job planning for high productivityManufacturing of thin structuresReducing required support structures for overhangsManufacturing of structural partsOptimising processes for manufacturing large componentsDevelopment of standardised processing language for different additive manufacturing machinesQuality assurance through sensing, data acquisition, processing, and machine learningDigitalisationSimulations and virtual models for lightweight products/technologies (digital twin)Intelligent process control (machine learning)Development of standardised processing language for different manufacturing machinesCoordination with European activities regarding Industry 4.0 (Gaia-X, Catena-X, etc.)Structural Health Monitoring of existing and new componentsBasic project requirementsYour project should:offer relevant contributions to the above-mentioned scope of the call,address at least one of the fields mentioned in the call description andfocus on experimental development (TRL 4-6) thus demonstrating the potential to research or develop a product, process or service for commercialisation.For further requirements, please check the section on “Eligibility”.Timeline2 April 2025:Announcement of the call15 May 2025:Call for projects opens23 October 2025:Call for projects deadlineDecember 2025 to March 2026:Eureka label and funding decisionsFebruary to June 2026:Projects can startWho can apply for this callEureka has limited eligibility criteria for organisations participating in a Network projects consortium:Your project idea must represent international cooperation in the form of a specific project.The project must be directed at researching or developing an innovative product, process, or service with the goal of commercialisation.The project must have a civilian purpose.Your consortium must include at least two independent legal entities from a minimum of two Eureka Call participating countries.
